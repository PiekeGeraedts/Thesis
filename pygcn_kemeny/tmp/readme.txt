Ignoring the 4 -V folders.
The folder name can be interpretted as follows: 
<Loss type>_<Normalisation method>_<Initialisation>_<Optimizer>

These folders are used to keep results for hyperparameterisation of lr, gamma and eta.
In order to keep the folders slightly orderly I keep only results for few param choices.
