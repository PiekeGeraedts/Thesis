These folders are used to keep results for hyperparameterisation of lr, gamma and eta.
In order to keep the folders slightly orderly I keep only results for few param choices.

The normalisation-RandomGraph folders show results for different normalisation methods. Check the subtract folder for benchmark results, parameter choices are kept the same across folders but the normalisation method is changed. NOTE: The parameter choices are based mainly on hyperparameterization using subtract.
