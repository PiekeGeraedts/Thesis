This folder contains results for the following optimisation:

- We optimised the standard gcn model for 200 epochs and later introduced Kemeny's constant as regularizer and trained the gcn model for another 50 epochs. The edge weights were only trainable parameters from epoch 200 onwards, results where edge weights are learnable from the start are in the other folder.

- Hyperparameter choices can be found in the log.txt file.
